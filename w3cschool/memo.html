    <h1> MEMO NOTE </h1>
    <img src = "memo1.jpg" alt = "coffee1" width = "500" height = "500">
    <h3>The pocket notebook has become as much a part of EDC culture as the bifold wallet
        <br> With the rise in popularity of smartphones in the past 10 years
        <br>why not just jot down information on an iPhone app and call it a day? 
        <br>Not only is jotting down lists onto a notebook with a pen still faster than opening your phone with your passcode
        <br>scrolling for the note-taking app you need, and typing away on a virtual keyboard that is a fraction of the size of your fingers
        <br>a pocket notebook is also more reliable than an $800 dollar piece of technology
        <br>will allow you to write down phone numbers, ideas, lists, and notes long after your smartphone’s battery has died at around lunch time. 
    </h3>
    <h3 style="color:brown">A pocket notebook fits securely in your back pocket and, unlike your smartphone
        <br>won’t crack or break when dropped from standing height. 
        <br>There are many different styles to choose from, depending on your lifestyle or personal carrying preferences 
        <br>with each EDC notebook offering it’s carrier something unique from the rest. 
        <br>Whether you’re looking to overhaul your current everyday carry ensemble or just add a bit more functionality to it</h3>
