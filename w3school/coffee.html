    <h3 style="color:brown">It happens millions of times each week – a customer receives a drink from a Starbucks barista – but each interaction is unique.
        <br>Try our Cold Brew coffee just the way you like it. With milk for a smoother flavour or choose one of our many dairy free options.
        <br>From our beginnings as a single store nearly forty years ago, in every place that we’ve been, 
        <br>and every place that we touch, we've tried to make it a little better than we found it.
        <br>By bringing people together over coffee, Starbucks has become one of the world’s best-known and best loved companies..</h3>
